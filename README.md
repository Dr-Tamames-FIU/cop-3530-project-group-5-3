DictionaryInterface, ListIndexOutOfBound, ListInterface, MyLinkedList are all from a past assignment and that code was provided by the assignment and is not my code. I used my old MyHashtable for the hashtable I assumed this was allowed because the assigment stated the structure would be provided. 

The project is a password manager that uses a hashtable to store and retrieve passwords. 
It has 6 features
